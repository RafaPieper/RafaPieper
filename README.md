## 👋 Hi, I’m Pieper

🧑‍🎓 I'm a Naval Architect and I’m currently enrolled in the Electronics Systems Engineering Graduate Program at [UFSC](https://ppgese.joinville.ufsc.br/en/) 

    My field of study is Applied Artificial Intelligence 🤖
   
    Machine Learning; Predictive maintenance; Signal processing; Time Series analysis


👀 I’m interested in data science, naval architecture and marine engineering, predictive maintenance
    
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy road trips 🚙 and love sailing ⛵
